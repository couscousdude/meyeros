## Development guide

To run locally, set up the project and make sure you have `pnpm` installed.

1. Install dependencies via `pnpm i`.
2. The source code is located in the `src` directory. Make your edits in here.
3. Run `pnpm dev` to automatically compile and run your script. Run `pnpm build`
   to just compile it without running, and `pnpm build:prod` to create a
   production ready build with minification.
